# Report Introduction:  

An app to share your favourite quotations. Deployed on Heroku with Postgres. 

# User Stories:

- As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there
- As a user, I want to be able to choose between signing up and logging in.


## Core features:
  
- user can view all posts
- user can leave a post
- user can return later and view post
- user can navigate from home to a sign-up or log-in page

# Project learnings:

- we practised building and deploying to a remote Heroku site using a Postgres database.
- while it did not make the deployed version, we learnt a lot in trying to implement authentication, including the bcrypt library
- we got more practice in requiring and exporting files, chaining promises and catching errors.
- we organised in close collaboration, thereby minimising problems on merging
- we practised using local servers and local databases for manual testing
- we made use of GitHub's project board

# Requirement analysis:

- the site is not very intuitive to use (navigation must be done for some pages via URL)
- the site achieves full marks on the Lighthouse Accessibility test
- the forms could have presented clearer visual feedback on invalid input

# ðŸ§  Project scope:

- This app is designed for users with a love of quotations and carbohydrates. 
- The main user story we were unable to complete was for a user to be the only person allowed to delete their posts. This was tied to a larger strand of authentication that we didn't manage to get working for the deployed version of the app. 
- With more time, we would have worked on getting this functioning. Similarly, Cypress testing and styling were left incomplete.
- We would have liked to get a more accessible and clear sign-up form 

# Recommendations and conclusions:

It was a successful collaboration but the project was left incomplete. We regret not being able to implement more features around authentication in particular, but we are proud of what did manage and the persistence it took to achieve it.
